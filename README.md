Explanation :
First line of the input contains the number of states (N) of NFA. Second line of the input says the number of input symbols (S). In example1 number of states of NFA is 6 i.e.( A, B, C, D, E, F) and 2 input symbols i.e. ( 0, 1). Since we are working on NFA with ∈ move, ∈ will be added as an extra input symbol. The next N lines contains the transition values for every state of NFA. The value of ith row, jth column indicates transition value for ith state on jth input symbol. Here in example1 transition(A, 0) : FC.

Output contains the NFA, ∈ closure for every states of the corresponding NFA and DFA obtained by converting the input NFA. States and input symbols of the DFA are also specified.
